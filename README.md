This repository demonstrates a classic off-by-one error in C++ when iterating through a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, attempting to access elements beyond the vector's valid index range.  The corrected version, `bugSolution.cpp`, shows the proper way to iterate, avoiding the potential for undefined behavior or crashes.  This is a common mistake for beginners and experienced programmers alike, highlighting the importance of careful attention to loop boundaries when working with dynamic arrays.
